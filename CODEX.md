# Using Code Discipline with Codex

This repository ships with a Codex-compatible skill so the Code Discipline methodology can be invoked directly from the Codex CLI. This document covers installation, invocation, configuration, and what to keep in sync when contributing.

---

## How It Works in Codex

The Codex CLI looks for skills under `~/.codex/skills`. Each skill is a folder that contains:

1. A `SKILL.md` file with the methodology text and YAML frontmatter (already present in this repo at [`skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md`](skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md)).
2. A Codex-specific metadata file at `agents/openai.yaml` ([`skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml`](skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml)) that controls UI presentation, the default prompt, and invocation policy.

When the skill folder is installed under `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline`, Codex makes it available across every project.

---

## Installation

From the root of this repository, copy or symlink the skill folder into the Codex skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
cp -R skills/code-discipline ~/.codex/skills/
```

Or, to keep the installed copy in sync with `git pull` on this repository, symlink instead:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/skills/code-discipline" ~/.codex/skills/code-discipline
```

After installing, restart Codex so it picks up the new skill.

---

## Invocation

### Explicit Invocation

Once installed, the skill can be invoked by name in any Codex prompt:

```
$code-discipline
```

When you include `$code-discipline` in a prompt, Codex loads the methodology and applies its principles to whatever task follows. You can combine it with the actual request:

```
$code-discipline fix the off-by-one bug in src/utils/sum.py
```

### Implicit Invocation

The bundled `openai.yaml` sets `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: true`. This means Codex may activate the skill automatically when the task description matches the skill's trigger phrases (defined in the `description` field of `SKILL.md`).

If you want manual-only invocation, edit your local copy of `agents/openai.yaml` and set `allow_implicit_invocation: false`. The skill will then only activate when you explicitly type `$code-discipline`.

---

## The `openai.yaml` File

This is the structure Codex reads:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: "Code Discipline"
  short_description: "<one-line summary shown in the Codex UI>"
  default_prompt: "<prompt Codex injects when the skill is invoked>"
policy:
  allow_implicit_invocation: true
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `interface.display_name` | Human-readable name shown in the Codex skill list. |
| `interface.short_description` | One-line summary shown in the UI. Keep it short and action-oriented. |
| `interface.default_prompt` | The text Codex prepends when the skill is invoked. This is what shapes the assistant's behavior. |
| `policy.allow_implicit_invocation` | If `true`, Codex can activate the skill automatically when the task fits. If `false`, only explicit `$code-discipline` invocation works. |

The version bundled in this repository sets implicit invocation **on** by default — the methodology is generally useful and rarely intrusive. Switch it to `false` if you prefer to stay in explicit-only mode.

## Codex vs. Claude Code vs. Cursor

| Surface | Use this skill format |
|---|---|
| **Codex CLI** | The full skill folder installed under `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline` (includes `SKILL.md` + `agents/openai.yaml`) |
| **Claude Code (CLI)** | The plugin installed via `/plugin install` |
| **Claude.ai (Web/Desktop)** | The skill content pasted into a custom skill |
| **Cursor IDE** | `.cursor/rules/code-discipline.mdc` (committed in repo or copied) |
| **Any project, any tool** | The contents of `CLAUDE.md` pasted into your project root |

Each surface reads a different file format — none of them interfere with the others. You can install the skill on multiple surfaces in the same project; they will not conflict.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Codex does not list the skill

- Confirm the folder is installed at exactly `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline`. The folder name must match `code-discipline`.
- Confirm `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md` exists.
- Confirm `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml` exists and is valid YAML.
- Restart Codex. The skill list is read at startup.

### Codex lists the skill but `$code-discipline` does nothing

- Open `~/.codex/skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml` and confirm the `interface.default_prompt` field is non-empty.
- Confirm there are no YAML syntax errors — a missing colon or unclosed quote will silently disable the skill.

### Codex never invokes the skill implicitly

- This is controlled by `policy.allow_implicit_invocation`. Set it to `true` if you want automatic activation.
- The trigger phrases live in `SKILL.md` under the `description` field. If the description does not include phrases that match your task wording, Codex will not auto-invoke. Either expand the description or invoke explicitly with `$code-discipline`.

### Codex applies the skill on tasks where it shouldn't

- Set `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` to limit activation to explicit invocation only.
- Or narrow the `description` field in `SKILL.md` to remove overly broad trigger phrases.

## For Contributors

If you change the six principles or any other content shared across surfaces, update **all** of the following so they stay in sync:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Zero-install, paste-into-any-project version |
| [`.cursor/rules/code-discipline.mdc`](.cursor/rules/code-discipline.mdc) | Cursor IDE rule |
| [`skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md`](skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md) | Claude Code plugin / Claude.ai / Codex skill body |
| [`skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml`](skills/code-discipline/agents/openai.yaml) | Codex-specific UI metadata and invocation policy |

The methodology text in the first three files must be identical. The `openai.yaml` does not duplicate the methodology — it only carries Codex-specific fields — but the `default_prompt` should reflect the principles accurately. If you add or remove a principle, update the prompt accordingly.

The version numbers in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `skills/code-discipline/SKILL.md` (`metadata.version`) must all match. Bump them together.
